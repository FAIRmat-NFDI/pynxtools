                                    control software. This is usually lower by a factor of 10
                                    than the sampling rate, because an internal oversampling of the
                                    signal is done on the real time engine. You can reduce the
                                    oversampling down to 1 in order to resolve higher frequencies
                                    in the Spectrum Analyzer. (e.g. 10).

                                    The Measurements period is the integration time for precise
                                    measurements (averaging over specified period), mostly used
                                    in sweep modules. Examples are recording of a force-distance
                                    curve or a resonance of a cantilever. For fast measurements
                                    with small steps, a value of 40 ms may be reasonable. For
                                    normal use, 300-500 ms is a good value, but for recording a
                                    resonance of a high-Q cantilever, values of several seconds
                                    might be necessary. Usually this parameter doesn \u2019t need
                                    to be set from this module; the sweep modules will set this
                                    value according to the sweep timings. (e.g. 500E-3) "
