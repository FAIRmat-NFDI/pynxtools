The folders contain examples of how you can convert your raw data, from your acquisition software or ELN, into a NeXus file using our [dataconverter](../nexusutils/dataconverter) for every experimental technique we currently support.

The folders all have [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that contain snippets of code one can execute to follow the different use cases of collecting data into a single NeXus file. Please refer to the individual README's for more details.
