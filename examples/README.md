We supply examples of how you can convert your raw data, from your acquisition software or ELN, into a NeXus file using our [dataconverter](../pynxtools/dataconverter) for various experimental techniques. Please refer to the individual README's inside each folder for details.

The examples contain code snippets for creating a NeXus file for the experimental technique according to a standardaised application definiton. It also features example [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that contain snippets of code one can execute to follow the different use cases of collecting data into a single NeXus file.

There is also a documentation of the [dataconverter](../pynxtools/dataconverter) available.
You can also write a [reader](../pynxtools/dataconverter/readers) for your experimental technique if it is note supported yet. Feel also free to [contact](../README.md#questions-suggestions) us if you need help.
