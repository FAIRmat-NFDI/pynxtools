Document steps of wet-lab sample preparation
############################################

Virtually all experiments require a preparation of the sample. As most techniques are surface-sensitive or probe exclusively the surface, the use of careful preparation
techniques is the key to successful experiments. Unfortunately, the quality of such processes is often difficult to reproduce. Nevertheless, documenting how samples
are prepared is relevant. This part of the proposal provides prototypes how descriptions of steps performed by human or robots in a lab could be described using NeXus.

    :ref:`NXlab_electro_chemo_mechanical_preparation`, :ref:`NXlab_sample_mounting`:
        Prototype application definitions for documenting steps during sample preparation.
