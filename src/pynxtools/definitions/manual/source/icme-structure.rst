Integrated Computational Materials Engineering
==============================================

With a large set of data schemas for computational geometry, and methods from condensed-matter physics as well as materials engineering we are convinced that the NeXus standardization framework can be one component of efforts to harmonize and consolidate the zoo of descriptions and data schemas used within the field of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME).

A status report along these lines of thoughts and ongoing efforts is available here: :ref:`Icme-Structure`.
