Work of scientists within FAIRmat how to handshake between instrument control software like EPICS and CAMELS using NeXus resulted in an application definition for exemplar temperature dependent IV curve measurements.
IV curve measurements are one example of a large group of so-called transport measurements. The key idea behind these is to monitor one or more observables under controlled environmental conditions and eventual stimuli applied on a sample.

Many techniques especially used within materials engineering fall into this category and thus could make use of specializations or extensions of NXiv_temp.
Examples include hardness measurements, nanoindentation, resistance, electro-chemical probing, or diffusion.
