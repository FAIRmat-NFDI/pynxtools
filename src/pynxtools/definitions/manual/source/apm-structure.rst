Atom-probe tomography
=====================

Atom probe tomography and related field-ion microscopy, aka atom probe microscopy (techniques) cover metrology methods with an origin in the materials science and condensed-matter physics communities. With its maturation and commercialization in the last two decades atom probe is increasingly being used for characterization of bio materials and fundamental science of field evaporation physics.

A status report of the ongoing work on data schemas for atom probe using NeXus is available here: :ref:`Apm-Structure`.
