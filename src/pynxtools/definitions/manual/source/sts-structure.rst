Scanning Tunneling Spectroscopy
===============================

Scientists of the scanning tunneling spectroscopy community and FAIRmat have worked together to create an application definition and related base classes for documenting scanning tunneling spectroscopy experiments.
This is one community under the large umbrella of scanning (probe) microscopy methods. A status report of these efforts will be reported here: :ref:`Stm-Structure`.
