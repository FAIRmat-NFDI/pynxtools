==================
NeXus Repositories
==================

NeXus NXDL class definitions (both base classes and application definitions) and
the NeXus code library source are held in a pair of git repositories on GitHub.

The repositories are world readable. You can browse them directly:

:NeXus code library and applications:
	https://github.com/nexusformat/code

:NeXus NXDL class definitions:
	https://github.com/nexusformat/definitions

:NeXus GitHub *organization*:
   https://github.com/nexusformat

If you would like to contribute (thank you!), the normal GitHub procedure of forking the repository and generating pull requests should be used.

Please report any problems via the
:ref:`Issue Reporting <IssueReporting>`
system.
