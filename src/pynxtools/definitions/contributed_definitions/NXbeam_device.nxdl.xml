         Properties of generic beam device in an experimental setup.
         
         Any beam related devices like source, detector, filter, mirror,
         beamsplitter, ... which may modifies a beam in an experimental setup
         can be described here with its experimental position and relationship
         to the other beam devices in the setup.
    </doc>
    <field name="previous_devices">
        <doc>
             Single device or list of devices pointing to the devices from which an
             beam originated to reach this device.
             This is used to describe a logical order of devices and for the whole setup.
             In this way, a "beam path" can be described (i.e., with starting point (light source) 
             and end point (photo detector)).
             
             Example: /entry/instrument/detector.

    <field name="purpose" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Description of the intended purpose of this device for
             the experimental setup.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="group" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Name of the group with which this device can be associated.
             For example, if a group of devices is used for second harmonic generation,
             all these devices have the group name "second harmonic generation".
             Is used for simplified setup vizualization (or description?).
        </doc>
    </field>
    <group type="NXtransformations">
        <doc>
             Location and orientation of the device. Note that even a
             simple distance can be given as a translation.
             
             You can use the @depends_on to describe from which device
             the transformation needs to be applied.
