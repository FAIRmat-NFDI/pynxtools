             containing the extrema of the transmitted energy window (smaller number first).
             With a swept scan of m steps it is a 2xm array of windows one for each

                     kinetic energy, :math:`R = (E_K - W/E_p)`, is scanned, but the pass energy :math:`E_p` is kept constant.
                     Here, :math:`W = e \phi` is the spectrometer work function (with the potential difference :math:`\phi_{\mathrm{sample}}`
                     between the electrochemical potential of electrons in the bulk and the electrostatic potential of an electron in the
                     vacuum just outside the surface).
                     
                     This mode is often used in XPS/UPS because the energy resolution does not change with
                     changing energy (due to the constant pass energy).

                     constant :math:`\Delta E/E` mode, where the pass energy is scanned such that the electron retardation
                     ratio is constant. In this mode, electrons of all energies are decelerated with this same
                     fixed factor. Thus, the pass energy is proportional to the kinetic energy. This mode is often
                     used in Auger electron spectroscopy (AES) to improve S/N for high-KE electrons, but this
                     leads to a changing energy resolution (:math:`\Delta E \sim E_p`) at different kinetic energies.
                     It can however also be used in XPS.

                <doc>
                     In the fixed energy (FE) mode, the intensity for one single kinetic energy is measured for a
                     specified time. This mode is particulary useful during setup or alignment of the
                     electron analyzer, for analysis of stability of the excitation source or for sample
                     alignment.
                     
                     Since the mode measures intensity as a function of time, the difference in channel signals
                     is not of interest. Therefore, the signals from all channels are summed.

            <item value="snapshot">
                <doc>
                     Snapshot mode does not involve an energy scan and instead collects data from all channels of
                     the detector without averaging. The resulting spectrum reflects the energy distribution of
                     particles passing through the analyzer using the current settings. This mode is commonly used
                     to position the detection energy at the peak of a peak and record the signal, enabling faster
                     data acquisition within a limited energy range compared to FAT. Snapshot measurements are
                     particularly suitable for CCD and DLD detectors, which have multiple channels and can accurately
                     display the peak shape. While five or nine-channel detectors can also be used for snapshot
                     measurements, their energy resolution is relatively lower.

                <doc>
                     In dither acquisition mode, the kinetic energy of the analyzer is randomly varied by a small value
                     around a central value and at fixed pass energy. This allows reducing or removing inhomogeneities
                     of the detector efficiency, such as e.g. imposed by a mesh in front of the detector.
                     Mostly relevant for CCD/DLD type of detectors.

             Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the location and

             Conventions from the NXtransformations base class are used. In principle,
             the McStas coordinate system is used. The first transformation has to point
             either to another  component of the system or . (for pointing to the reference frame)
             to relate it relative to the experimental setup. Typically, the components of a system
             should all be related relative to each other and only one component should relate to
             the reference coordinate system.
