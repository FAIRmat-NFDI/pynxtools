    <doc>
         A set of activities that occurred to a physical entity prior/during experiment.
         
         Ideally, a full report of the previous operations (or links to a chain of operations).
         Alternatively, notes allow for additional descriptors in any format.
    </doc>
    <group type="NXactivity">
        <doc>
             Any activity that was performed on the physical entity prior or during the experiment. In
             the future, if there is base class inheritance, this can describe any activity,
             including processes and measurements.
        </doc>
    </group>
    <!--For now, one workaround would be to have NXactivity as a application definition with a subentry.

Any activity that was performed on the physical entity prior or during the experiment.

    <group type="NXphysical_process">
        <doc>
             Any physical process that was performed on the physical entity prior or during the
             experiment.

    </group>
    <group type="NXchemical_process">
        <doc>

    </group>
    <group type="NXidentifier">
        <doc>
             An ID or reference to the location or a unique (globally
             persistent) identifier of e.g. another file which gives
             as many as possible details of the history event.
        </doc>
    </group>
    <!--There should be more activities here, like measurement.-->
    <group name="notes" type="NXnote">
        <doc>
             A descriptor to keep track of the treatment of the physical entity before or during the
             experiment (NXnote allows to add pictures, audio, movies). Alternatively, a
             reference to the location or a unique identifier or other metadata file. In the
             case these are not available, free-text description.
             This should only be used in case that there is no rigorous description
             using the base classes above. This field can also be used to pull in any activities
             that are not well described by an existing base class definition.
