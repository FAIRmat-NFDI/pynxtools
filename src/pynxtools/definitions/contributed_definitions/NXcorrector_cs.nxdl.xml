         Corrector for aberrations in an electron microscope.
         
         Different technology partners use different naming schemes and
         models for quantifying the aberration coefficients.
         
         The corrector in an electron microscope is composed of multiple lenses
         and multipole stigmators with details specific for the technology partner
         and microscope. Many of their technical details is proprietary knowledge.

             Specific information about the concrete alignment procedure which is a
             process during which the corrector is configured to enable a calibrated
             usage of the instrument.
             
             This :ref:`NXprocess` group should also be used when one describes in a computer
             simulation the specific details about the modelled or assumed aberration
             corrections. In effect, this base class can also be used for harmonizing
             the description of such simulation details across different computer codes
             to enable that a research data management system can find these information
             in a common place - formatted in a normalized representation.
             This reduces the necessity to include substantial case-dependent verification
             code in the research data management system.
