             By mixing the input signal (STS signal) with the modulated signal (such as Bias)
             and comparing it with the reference signal, they are enhanced and the effects of
             noise interference are reduced, resulting in more accurate measurements.

        <doc>
             A modulation signal (such as bias, current et.al.) is a periodic voltage signal,
             usually applied to the surface of a sample, which serves to modify the physical
             properties of the sample surface and generate weak AC current signals that can
             be detected and analysed by instruments such as lock-in amplifiers.

             The input signal (STS signal) will be demodulated, in order to determine the amplitude
