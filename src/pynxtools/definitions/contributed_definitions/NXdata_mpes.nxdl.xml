         :ref:`NXdata_mpes` describes the plottable data and related dimension scales in photoemission
         experiments.
         
         It extends the NXdata class and provides a glossary of explicitly named axis names
         which are typical for photoemission data.

        <doc>
             One calibrated k-space coordinate. It is envisioned that the axes are named kx, ky, and kz,
             in accordance with the calibrations defined in NXprocess_mpes.
             
             Typically, the vectors in momentum space are defined such that kx and ky comprise the parallel component,
             while kz is taken as the perpendicular component.
             
             It is also possible to define k_parallel and k_perp for the parallel and perpendicular momenta, respectively.
             Units are 1/Angstr√∂m.

             in accordance with the calibrations defined in NXprocess_mpes.
             
             The angular axes should be named in order of decreasing speed, i.e., angular0 should be
             the fastest scan axis and angular1 should be the slow-axis angular coordinate. However,
             angular0 may also be second slow axis if the measurement is angularly integrated and angular1
             could also be the second fast axis in the case of simultaneous dispersion in two angular
             dimensions.
