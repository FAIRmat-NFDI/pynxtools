         Base class for a set of :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.
         
         Members of the set are instances of :ref:`NXevent_data_em`. These have an associated
         time interval during which the conditions were considered stable and
         fit enough for purpose.
         
         Which temporal granularity is adequate depends on the situation and
         research question. Using a model which enables a collection of events offers
         the most flexible way to cater for both experiments with controlled electron
         beams in a real microscope or the simulation of such experiments or
         individual aspects of such experiments.
