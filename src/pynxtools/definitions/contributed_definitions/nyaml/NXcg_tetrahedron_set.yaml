  Computational geometry description of a set of tetrahedra.
  
  Among hexahedral elements, tetrahedral elements are one of the most
  frequently used geometric primitive for meshing and describing volumetric
  objects in continuum-field simulations.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of tetrahedra.

  #     Interior angle values for each tetrahedron.
  #     The quadruplet of angles is a sequence following the order of the vertices.
  #     The angle is the angle at the specific vertex.

  #     The sequence of the vertices follows their definition in tetrahedra.
