  Computational geometry description of a set of (oriented) unit normal vectors.
  
  Store normal vector information as properties of primitives.
  Use only only as a child of an instance of :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set`
  so that this instance acts as the parent to define a context.
# eventually remove this base class and make normal vector a property of the primitive
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of unit normals.

# the benefit of NXcg_point_set is that the origin is 0 by default
# how to resolve the association between the unit normal and its associated primitive?
# rather make this a set of vectors, irrespective whether these are unit or not
type: group
NXcg_unit_normal_set(NXobject):
  normals(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Direction of each normal - a unit normal.
    unit: NX_LENGTH  # length is normalized to 1 but it remains a length quantity
    dim: (c, d)
  orientation(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Qualifier which details the orientation of each normal vector
      in relation to its primitive, assuming the object is viewed
      from a position outside the object.
      
      * 0 - undefined
      * 1 - outer unit normal vector
      * 2 - inner unit normal vector
