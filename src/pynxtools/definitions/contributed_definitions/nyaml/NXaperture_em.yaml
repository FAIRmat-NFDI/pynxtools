      This is not always just the diameter of the aperture (not even in the case)
      of a circular aperture. Usually, it is a value that is set in the control
      software whereby a specific configuration of an aperture is selected by the
      software.
      
      The control software of commercial microscope typically offers the user
      access at a high abstraction level because of which many details about
      the actual settings of the electrical components are typically unknown.
      
      However, if more details are known or should be documented one should
      use the description field for this.
