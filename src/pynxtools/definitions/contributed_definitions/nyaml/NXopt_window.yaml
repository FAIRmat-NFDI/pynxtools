  A window of a cryostat, heater, vacuum chamber or a simple glass slide.

  This first verion originates from NXopt to describe cryostate windows
  and possible influences for ellipsometry measurements.

  For environmental measurements, the environment (liquid, vapor
  etc.) is enclosed in a cell, which has windows both in the
  direction of the source (entry window) and the detector (exit
  window) (looking from the sample). In case that the entry and exit
  windows are not the same type and do not have the same properties,
  use a second 'WINDOW(NXaperture)' field.
  
  The windows also add a phase shift to the light altering the
  measured signal. This shift has to be corrected based on measuring
  a known sample (reference sample) or the actual sample of interest
  in the environmental cell. State if a window correction has been
  performed in 'window_effects_corrected'. Reference data should be
  considered as a separate experiment, and a link to the NeXus file
  should be added in reference_data_link in measured_data.
  
  The window is considered to be a part of the sample stage but also
  beam path. Hence, its position within the beam path should be
  defined by the 'depends_on' field.

          Describe when (before or after the main measurement + time
          stamp in 'date') and how the window effects have been
          corrected, i.e. either mathematically or by performing a
          reference measurement. In the latter case, provide the link to
          to the reference data in 'reference_data_link'.
      reference_data_link:
        doc: |
          Link to the NeXus file which describes the reference data if a
          reference measurement for window correction was performed.
          Ideally, the reference measurement was performed on a reference
          sample and on the same sample, and using the same conditions as
          for the actual measurement with and without windows. It should
          have been conducted as close in time to the actual measurement
          as possible.
