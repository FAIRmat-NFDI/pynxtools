  Base class for a set of :ref:`NXevent_data_em` instances.
  
  Members of the set are instances of :ref:`NXevent_data_em`. These have an associated
  time interval during which the conditions were considered stable and
  fit enough for purpose.
  
  Which temporal granularity is adequate depends on the situation and
  research question. Using a model which enables a collection of events offers
  the most flexible way to cater for both experiments with controlled electron
  beams in a real microscope or the simulation of such experiments or
  individual aspects of such experiments.

NXevent_data_em_set(NXobject):
      # because it should be possible to use the application definition
      # to store e.g. just some descriptions about the instrument
      # to which eventually no measurements are attached
      # this would enable to use nxs files also for instrument
      # inventory system like offered through ELNs/or LIMS
