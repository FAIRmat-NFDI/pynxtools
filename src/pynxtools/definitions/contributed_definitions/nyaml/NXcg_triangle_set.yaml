  Computational geometry description of a set of triangles.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of triangles.
  n_unique: |
    The number of unique vertices supporting the triangles.
type: group
NXcg_triangle_set(NXcg_primitive_set):
  number_of_unique_vertices(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Number of unique vertices in the triangle set.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  triangles(NXcg_face_list_data_structure):
    doc: |
      Combined storage of all primitives of all triangles.
      
      This description resembles the typical representation of primitives
      in file formats such as OFF, PLY, VTK, or STL.
  triangleID(NXcg_face_list_data_structure):
    doc: |
      Individual storage of each triangle.
      Users are advised that using such individual storage of primitives
      may be less storage efficient than creating a combined storage.
  # ##MK::considered too trivial:
  # triangle_half_edgeID(NXcg_half_edge_data_structure):
  #   doc: |
  #     Individual storage of each triangle as a graph.
  # properties of triangles
  edge_length(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Length of the edges of each triangle.
      
      For each triangle values are reported via traversing
      the vertices in the sequence as these are defined.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (c, 3)
  interior_angle(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Interior angles of each triangle.
      
      For each triangle values are reported for the angle opposite
      to the respective edges in the sequence how vertices are defined.
    unit: NX_ANGLE
    dim: (c, 3)
