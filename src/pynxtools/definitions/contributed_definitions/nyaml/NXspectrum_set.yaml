  Base class container for reporting a set of spectra.
  
  The mostly commonly used scanning methods are supported.
  That is one-, two-, three-dimensional regularly sampled ROIs.
  
  For randomly or dissimilarly spaced scan points use collection instead.
symbols:
  n_p: |
    Number of scan points.
  n_z: |
    Number of pixel in the slowest direction.
  n_y: |
    Number of pixel in the slow direction.
  n_x: |
    Number of pixel in the fast direction.
  n_energy: |
    Number of energy bins.
