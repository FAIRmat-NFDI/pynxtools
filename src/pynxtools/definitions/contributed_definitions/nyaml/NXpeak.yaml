doc: |
  Base class for spectral peaks, their functional form, and support (values).
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  n_support: |
    Number of support points
type: group
NXpeak(NXobject):
  label(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Human-readable label which specifies which concept/entity
      the peak represents/identifies.
  description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Is the peak described analytically via a functional form
      or is it empirically defined via measured/reported
      intensity/counts as a function of an independent variable.
      
      If the functional form is not empirical or Gaussians, users
      should enter other for the peak_model and add relevant details
      in the NXcollection.
    enumeration: [empirical, gaussian, lorentzian, voigt, other]
  position(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
      this array holds the position values for the independent variable.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dim: (n_support,)
  intensity(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      In the case of an empirical description of the peak and its shoulders,
      this array holds the intensity/count values at each position.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dim: (n_support,)
  (NXparameters):
    doc: |
      In the case of an analytical description (or if peak_model is other) this
      collection holds parameter of (and eventually) the functional form.
      For example in the case of Gaussians mu, sigma, cut-off values,
      and background intensity are relevant parameter.
