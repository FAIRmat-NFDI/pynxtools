  Corrector for aberrations in an electron microscope.
  
  Different technology partners use different naming schemes and
  models for quantifying the aberration coefficients.
  
  The corrector in an electron microscope is composed of multiple lenses
  and multipole stigmators with details specific for the technology partner
  and microscope. Many of their technical details is proprietary knowledge.

      This :ref:`NXprocess` group should also be used when one describes in a computer
      simulation the specific details about the modelled or assumed aberration
      corrections. In effect, this base class can also be used for harmonizing
      the description of such simulation details across different computer codes
      to enable that a research data management system can find these information
      in a common place - formatted in a normalized representation.
      This reduces the necessity to include substantial case-dependent verification
      code in the research data management system.
