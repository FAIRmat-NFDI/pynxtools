category: base
doc: |
  A set of nodes representing members of a graph.
  
  Use as a direct child of an instance of :ref:`NXgraph_root`.
  Alternatively, use depends_on to specify which instance
  of NXgraph_root is defined by this instance.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of nodes of the graph.
  d: |
    The dimensionality of the graph. Eventually use one for categorical.
type: group
NXgraph_node_set(NXobject):
  \@depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Specify which instance of :ref:`NXgraph_root` this :ref:`NXgraph_node_set` refers to.
  space(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      About which space does the graph make statements.
    enumeration: [euclidean, other]
  dimensionality(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Dimensionality of the space about which the graph makes statements.
      Use only when value of the field space is euclidean.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    enumeration: [1, 2, 3]
  cardinality(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Number of nodes of the graph.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  identifier_offset(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Integer which specifies the first index to be used for distinguishing
      nodes. Identifiers are defined either implicitly or explicitly.
      
      For implicit indexing the identifiers are defined on the interval
      :math:`[identifier\_offset, identifier\_offset + c - 1]`.
      
      For explicit indexing use the field identifier. For implicit indexing,
      consult :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set` to get guidance how to set identifier_offset.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
  identifier(NX_INT):
    doc: |
      Integer used to distinguish nodes for explicit indexing.
    unit: NX_UNITLESS
    dim: (c,)
  is_a(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      A human-readable qualifier which type or e.g. class instance the
      node is an instance of. An example: a NeXus application definition is a
      graph, more specifically a hierarchical directed labelled property graph.
      Instances which are groups like :ref:`NXgraph_node_set` could have an is_a
      qualifier reading :ref:`NXgraph_node_set`.
    dim: (c,)
  label(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      A human-readable label/caption/tag of each node.
    dim: (c,)
