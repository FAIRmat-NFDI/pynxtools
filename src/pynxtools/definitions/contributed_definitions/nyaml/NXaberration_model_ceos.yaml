  for different definitions available and further details. Table 7-2 of Ibid.
  publication (page 305ff) documents how to convert from the NION to the
  CEOS definitions.

  # further comments from Thilo Remmele (Leibniz-Institut für Kristallzüchtung)
  # ThermoFisher uses CEOS correctors but makes customizations to these in their microscopes
  # Aberration naming schema: C_order_multiplicity (similar to NXem, but with
  # another coordinate system and in addition with a confidence entry.
  # Aberrations with multiplicity 0 have no angle entry (C1,C3,C5,.., CEOS notation)
  # contrast transferfuntion: ctf = e^(-i*Xi(g)) in Fourier space
  # aberration function:
  # Xi(g) = 2*pi/lamda{ 1/2 * (lamda*g)^2 (C20 + C22 cos[2(phi-phi_22)]
  # +1/3 * (lamda*g)^3 (C31 cos[(phi-phi_31) + C33 cos[3(phi-phi_33)
  # +1/4 * (lamda*g)^4 (C40 + C42 cos[2(phi-phi_42)] + C44 cos[4(phi-phi_42)]
  # +1/f * (lamda*g)^f Sum (Cfm cos[m(phi-phi_fm)] where m=[0,2,..f] for even f and m=[1,3,..,f] for odd f
  
  # Thilo Remmele also mentions that there is a mapping of aberration coefficient names:
  # C_2_0 -> C1 Defocus
  # C_2_2 -> A1 2-fold astigmatism
  # C_3_3 -> A2 3-fold astigmatism
  # C_3_1 -> B2 axial coma
  # C_4_0 -> C3 spherical aberration
  # C_4_4 -> A3 4-fold astigmatism
  # C_4_2 -> S3 star aberration
  # C_5_5 -> A4 5-fold astigmatism
  
  # C_5_1 -> B4 axial coma
  # C_5_3 -> D4 three lobe aberration
  # C_6_0 -> C5 spherical aberration
  # C_6_2 -> S5 star aberration
  # C_6_4 -> R5 rosette aberration
  # C_6_6 -> A5 6-fold astigmatism
  
  # In a session with HRTEM images the corrector is commonly aligned.
  # The final measurement with the estimated residual aberrations
  # should be saved in a corrector.html file (an example is appended
  # at the end of this file. Unfortunately the datetime is not included
  # in that html output, nor is the used outer tilt angle and exposure time.
  # The datetime may be estimated from the file datetime and the Delta t entry,
  # but caution if that datetime is not preserved on file transfers!
  # More than one detector entry could occure but is not common.
  # A seperate corrector schema, so it can be easily exchanged to other correctors if necessary.
  # It might be useful to collect all the corrector entries in one table, for example to analyse the performance of the corrector.
  # The corrector entry of the nexus em definition lacks the confidence information and the
  # parameter settings for the estimation oft the aberrations.
