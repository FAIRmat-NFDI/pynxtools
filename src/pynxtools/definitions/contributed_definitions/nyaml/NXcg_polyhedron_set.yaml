  Computational geometry description of a set of polyhedra in Euclidean space.
  
  Polyhedra or so-called cells (especially in the convex of tessellations) are
  constructed from polygon meshes. Polyhedra may make contact to allow a usage
  of this base class for a description of tessellations.
  
  For the description of more complicated manifolds and especially for polyhedra
  with holes, users are advised to check if their particular needs are described
  by creating customized instances of an :ref:`NXcg_polygon_set`.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of polyhedra.
  n_e_total: |
    The total number of edges for all polyhedra.
  n_f_total: |
    The total number of faces for all polyhedra.
# it is useful to define own base classes for frequently used classes
# a polyhedron is a specific polytope in 3d, do we need
# higher-dimensional polytopes? that could be useful for simplicies though
# as they are used in numerics etc. maybe reach out here to our friends
# from MarDI, for now let's assume we do not need polytopes for d > 3
# NeXus already supports polyhedra via NXoff_geometry
# the here proposed base class extends the capabilities to qualifiers of
# polyhedra and also half_edge_data_structures that can be useful
# for clean graph-based descriptions of polyhedra.
