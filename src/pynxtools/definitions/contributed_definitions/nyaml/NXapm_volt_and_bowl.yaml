  Base class for the configuration and results from a voltage-and-bowl ToF correction algorithm.
  
  The voltage-and-bowl correction is a ata post-processing step to correct for ion impact position
  flight path differences, detector biases, and nonlinearities.

  n: |
    Number of ions spatially filtered from results of the hit_finding algorithm
    :ref:`NXapm_hit_finding` from which an instance of a reconstructed volume
    has been generated. These ions get new identifier assigned in the process -
    the so-called evaporation_identifier, which must not be confused with
    the pulse_identifier!

  # but not necessarily unprocessed timing data from the detector (unless individuals built the instrument).
  # Relevant for ranging are the calibrated data, thats why only these
  # (as an intermediate/compromise solution) are required in this version of the application definition
