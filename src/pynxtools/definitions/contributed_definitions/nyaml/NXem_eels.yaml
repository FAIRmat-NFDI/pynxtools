  Base class method-specific for Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS).
# symbols:
  # n_energy_loss: Number of electron energy loss bins.
type: group
NXem_eels(NXem_method):
  # NXem_method also has an NXprocess which in this base class can be
  # specialized to include EELS-specific post-processing
