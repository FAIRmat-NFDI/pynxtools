  Computational geometry description of a set of cylinders.
  
  The radius can either be defined in the radii field or by filling both
  the upper_cap_radii or lower_cap_radii field. The latter field case can
  thus be used to represent truncated cones.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality of the space in which the members are assumed embedded.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of members.
# redundant as there is NXcsg, NXquadric, NXsolid_geometry with which
# cylinder could be constructed, but NXcylinder is easier to understand
type: group
NXcg_cylinder_set(NXcg_primitive_set):
  height(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      A direction vector which is parallel to the cylinder/cone axis
      and whose magnitude is the height of the cylinder/cone.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (c, d)
  # observe that although we claim that d is the dimensionality we have
  # currently no strategy to tell it must not be d but the actual value
  # equally so the symbol c, currently all we say that in the specialization
  # defined here the fields radii, upper_cap_radius, and others are all having
  # value arguments of the same shape, i.e. these are arrays of rank one with some length c!
  # behind the dimensionality field defined either in the here defined specialization
  # of NXcg_primitive_set or otherwise that variable is undefined
  # alternatively one could store the center of the lower and upper cap but
  # these are then no longer necessarily on the same axis
  # maybe a future feature for representing skewed cylinder, but then
  # one should really better use NXquadric...
  radius(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Radius of the cylinder if all have the same radius.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  radii(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Radii of the cylinder.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (c,)
  upper_cap_radii(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Radii of the upper circular cap.
      
      This field, combined with lower_cap_radius can be used to describe
      (eventually truncated) circular cones.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (c,)
  lower_cap_radii(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Radii of the upper circular cap.
      
      This field, combined with upper_cap_radius can be used to describe
      (eventually truncated) circular cones.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    dim: (c,)
  # properties of the cylinder
  lateral_surface_area(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Lateral surface area
    unit: NX_AREA
    dim: (c,)
  upper_cap_surface_area(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Area of the upper cap of each cylinder.
    unit: NX_AREA
    dim: (c,)
  lower_cap_surface_area(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Area of the lower cap of each cylinder.
    unit: NX_AREA
    dim: (c,)
  total_surface_area(NX_NUMBER): # example for a specialization of surface_area from the NXcg_primitive_set
    doc: |
      Sum of upper and lower cap areas and lateral surface area
      of each cylinder.
    unit: NX_AREA
    dim: (c,)
  # again cap, lateral surface area and volume are so trivial to compute
  # do we need really storage for this or recompute on-the-fly?
  # similarly to hollow sphere discussion, hollow cylinder, cylinder stack
  # do wish to define intersections?, if this is the case, one
  # should use the NXcsg and NXquadric descriptions?
