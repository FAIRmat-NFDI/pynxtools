  Base class for the configuration and results of ranging definitions.
  
  Ranging is a data post-processing step used in the research field of
  atom probe during which elemental, isotopic, and/or molecular identities
  are assigned to mass-to-charge-state-ratios within a certain interval.
  The documentation of these steps is based on ideas that
  have been described in the literature:
  
  * `M. K. Miller <https://doi.org/10.1002/sia.1719>`_
  * `D. Haley et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927620024290>`_
  * `M. Kühbach et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012241>`_

  number_of_ion_types(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      How many ion types are distinguished. If no ranging was performed, each
      ion is of the special unknown type. The iontype ID of this unknown type
      is 0 representing a reserve value. Consequently,
      iontypes start counting from 1.

  maximum_number_of_atoms_per_molecular_ion(NX_UINT):
    doc: |
      Assumed maximum value that suffices to store all relevant
      molecular ions, even the most complicated ones.
      Currently, a value of 32 is used (see M. Kühbach et al. <https://doi.org/10.1017/S1431927621012241>`_).

  mass_to_charge_distribution(NXprocess):

      Specifies the mass-to-charge-state-ratio histogram.

    mass_spectrum(NXdata):
      doc: |
        A default histogram aka mass spectrum of
        the mass-to-charge-state ratio values.

      correct the total counts per bin into counts.

      doc: |
        To begin with we use a free-text field to learn how
        atom probers define a background model. Future versions
        of NXapm_ranging can then use this information to parameterize
        these models.
  # NEW ISSUE: add parameters of the background model in an e.g.
  # NXcollection as these are specific to every background model
  # NEW ISSUE: touching upon i.e. research activities by Andrew London et al.
  # substantiating the need for a clearer description how peak/signals were
  # eventually processed via deconvolution methods

      How where peaks in the background-corrected in the histogram
      of mass-to-charge-state ratio values identified?
