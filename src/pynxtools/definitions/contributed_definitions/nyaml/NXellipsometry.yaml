  This is the application definition describing ellipsometry experiments.
  
  Such experiments may be as simple as identifying how a reflected
  beam of light with a single wavelength changes its polarization state,
  to a variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry experiment.
  
  The application definition specifies optical spectroscopy (NXopt), by extending
  the terms and setting specific requirements.
