  Base class for an electro-magnetic lens or a compound lens.
  
  For :ref:`NXtransformations` the origin of the coordinate system is placed
  in the center of the lens (its polepiece, pinhole, or another
  point of reference). The origin should be specified in the :ref:`NXtransformations`.
  
  For details of electro-magnetic lenses in the literature

# more consolidation to harvest from a generic component base class

NXlens_em(NXobject):
  type(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Qualitative type of lens with respect to the number of pole pieces.
    enumeration: [single, double, quadrupole, hexapole, octupole]
  # purpose(NX_CHAR):
  #   enumeration: [c1, c2, diffraction, etc.]
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Given name, alias, colloquial, or short name for the lens.
      For manufacturer names and identifiers use respective manufacturer fields.
  # manufacturer_name:
  #   doc: |
  #     Name of the manufacturer who built/constructed the lens.
  (NXfabrication):
  # model:
  #   doc: |
  #     Hardware name, hash identifier, or serial number that was given by the
  #     manufacturer to identify the lens.
  description(NX_CHAR):  # NXidentifier
    doc: |
      Ideally an identifier, persistent link, or free text which
      gives further details about the lens.
  voltage(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Excitation voltage of the lens.
      
      For dipoles it is a single number.
      For higher order multipoles, it is an array.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
  current(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Excitation current of the lens.
      
      For dipoles it is a single number.
      For higher order multipoles, it is an array.
    unit: NX_CURRENT
  value(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      This field should be used when the exact voltage or current of the lens is not
      directly controllable as the control software of the microscope  does not enable
      or was not configured to display these values (for end users).
      
      In this case this value field should be used and the value
      from the control software stored as is.
      
      Although this value does not document the exact physical voltage or
      excitation, it can still give useful context to reproduce the lens setting,
      provided a properly working instrument and software sets the lens
      into a similar state to the technical level possible when no more 
      information is available physically or accessible legally.
    unit: NX_ANY
  mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      This field should be used when the exact operation mode of the lens
      is not directly controllable as the control software of the microscope
      does not enable or was not configured to display these values.
      
      Like value the mode can only be interpreted for a specific microscope
      but can still be useful to guide users as to how to repeat the measurement.
  \@depends_on(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Specifies the position of the lens by pointing to the last transformation in the
      transformation chain in the NXtransformations group.
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the
      location and geometry of the lens as a component in the instrument.
      Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to
      each other and only one component should relate to the reference
      coordinate system.
