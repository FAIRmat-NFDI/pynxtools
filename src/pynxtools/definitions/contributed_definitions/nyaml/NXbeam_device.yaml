  Properties of generic beam device in an experimental setup.

  Any beam related devices like source, detector, filter, mirror,
  beamsplitter, ... which may modifies a beam in an experimental setup
  can be described here with its experimental position and relationship
  to the other beam devices in the setup.

  
NXbeam_device(NXobject):

  previous_devices: 
    doc: |
      Single device or list of devices pointing to the devices from which an
      beam originated to reach this device.
      This is used to describe a logical order of devices and for the whole setup.
      In this way, a "beam path" can be described (i.e., with starting point (light source) 
      and end point (photo detector)).

      Example: /entry/instrument/detector.
  purpose(NX_CHAR): 
    doc: |
      Description of the intended purpose of this device for
      the experimental setup.

  group(NX_CHAR): 
    doc: |
      Name of the group with which this device can be associated.
      For example, if a group of devices is used for second harmonic generation,
      all these devices have the group name "second harmonic generation".
      Is used for simplified setup vizualization (or description?).


  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Location and orientation of the device. Note that even a
      simple distance can be given as a translation.

      You can use the @depends_on to describe from which device
      the transformation needs to be applied.
