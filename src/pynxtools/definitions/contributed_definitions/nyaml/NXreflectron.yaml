  Base class for a device which reduces ToF differences of ions in ToF experiments.
  
  For atom probe the reflectron can be considered an energy compensation device.
  Such a device can be realized technically for example with a Poschenrieder lens.
  
  Consult the following U.S. patents for further details:
  
  * 3863068 and 6740872 for the reflectron
  * 8134119 for the curved reflectron
    
symbols:

    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  p: |
    Number of pulses collected in between start_time and end_time
    resolved by an instance of :ref:`NXevent_data_apm`.

NXreflectron(NXobject):
  status(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Status of eventual existence and potential usage of this reflectron.
    enumeration: [none, present, used]
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Given name/alias.
  (NXfabrication):
  description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Free-text field to specify further details about the reflectron.
      The field can be used to inform e. g. if the reflectron is flat or curved.
  voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      The maximum voltage applied to the reflectron, relative to system ground.
    unit: NX_VOLTAGE
    # dim: (p,)
  (NXtransformations):
    doc: |
      Affine transformation(s) which detail where the reflectron is located
      relative to e.g. the origin of the specimen space reference coordinate
      system. This group can also be used for specifying how the reflectron
      is rotated relative to a given axis in the instrument.
    # The purpose of these more detailed instrument descriptions
    # is to support the creation of a digital twin of the instrument
    # for computational science.
