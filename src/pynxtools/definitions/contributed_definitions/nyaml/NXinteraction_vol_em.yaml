  Base class for describing the interaction volume of particle-matter interaction.
  
  Computer models like Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics / electron- or ion-beam
  interaction simulations can be used to qualify and (or) quantify the shape of
  the interaction volume. Results of such simulations can be summary statistics
  or single-particle resolved sets of trajectories.
  
  Explicit or implicit descriptions are possible.
  
  * An implicit description is via a set of electron/specimen interactions
    represented ideally as trajectory data from the computer simulation.
  * An explicit description is via an iso-contour surface using either
    a simulation grid or a triangulated surface mesh of the approximated
    iso-contour surface evaluated at specific threshold values.
    Iso-contours could be computed from electron or particle fluxes through
    an imaginary control surface (the iso-surface).
    Threshold values can be defined by particles passing through a unit control
    volume (electrons) or energy-levels (e.g. the case of X-rays).
    Details depend on the model.
  * Another explicit description is via theoretical models which may
    be relevant e.g. for X-ray spectroscopy
  
  Further details on how the interaction volume can be quantified
  is available in the literature for example:
