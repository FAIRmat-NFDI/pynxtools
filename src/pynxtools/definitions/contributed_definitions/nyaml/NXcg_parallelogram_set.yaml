  Computational geometry description of a set of parallelograms.
  
  This class can also be used to describe rectangles or squares, irrespective
  whether these are axis-aligned or not. The class represents different
  access and description levels to embrace applied scientists and computational
  geometry experts with their different views:
  
  * The simplest case is the communication of dimensions aka the size of a
    region of interest in the 2D plane. In this case, communicating the
    alignment with axes is maybe not as relevant as it is to report the area
    of the ROI.
  * In other cases the extent of the parallelogram is relevant though.
  * Finally, in CAD models it should be possible to specify the polygons
    which the parallelograms represent with exact numerical details.
  
  Parallelograms are important geometrical primitives as their usage for
  describing many scanning experiments shows where typically parallelogram-shaped
  ROIs are scanned across the surface of a sample.
  
  The term parallelogram will be used throughout this base class thus including
  the important special cases rectangle, square, 2D box, axis-aligned bounding box
  (AABB), or optimal bounding box (OBB) as analogous 2D variants to their 3D
  counterparts. See :ref:`NXcg_hexahedron_set` for the generalization in 3D.
  
  An axis-aligned bounding box is a common data object in computational science
  and simulation codes to represent a rectangle whose edges are aligned with the
  axes of a coordinate system. As a part of binary trees AABBs are important data
  objects for executing time- as well as space-efficient queries
  of geometric primitives in techniques like kd-trees.
  
  An optimal bounding box is a common data object which provides the best, i.e.
  most tightly fitting box about an arbitrary object. In general such boxes are
  rotated. Other than in 3D dimensions, the rotation calipher method offers
  a rigorous approach to compute an optimal bounding box to a point set in 2D.
