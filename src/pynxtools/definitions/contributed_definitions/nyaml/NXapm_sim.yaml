  Base class for simulating ion extraction from matter via laser and/or voltage pulsing.
  
  Ideally, we would like to describe the workflow of experiments and simulations of
  atom probe and field-evaporation simulation research in more detail and contextualize
  better descriptions of experiments and computer simulations.
  The strategy to achieve this is detailed in the introducing docstring of
  :ref:`NXapm_msr`. This :ref:`NXapm_sim` base class is envisioned as the
  twin of the :ref:`NXapm_msr` base class.
# noteworthy the situation is similar to electron microscopy especially TEM where factually
# interpretation without simulations is pointless. The only difference is that in EM there
# is a large availability of documentation and open-source tools for performing such simulations.

NXapm_sim(NXobject):  # when evolving these ideas further inherit from NXapm_method instead
