      Triplet of the minimum, the increment, and the maximum identifier to
      include of a sequence :math:`[i_0, i_0 + 1, i_0 + 2, \ldots, i_0 + \mathcal{N}] with i_0 \in \mathcal{Z}`
      of identifier. The increment controls which n-th identifier (value) to take.
      
      Take as an example a dataset with 100 identifier (aka entries). Assume that
      the identifier start at zero, i.e. identifier_offset is 0). Assume further
      that min_incr_max is set to [0, 1, 99]. In this case the filter will
      yield all identifier. Setting min_incr_max to [0, 2, 99] will take each
      second identifier. Setting min_incr_max to [90, 3, 99] will take each
      third identifier beginning from identifier 90 up to 99.
