  Computational geometry description of a set of points.
  
  Points may have an associated time value. Users are advised though to store
  time data of point sets rather as instances of time events, where for each
  point in time there is an :ref:`NXcg_point_set` instance which specifies the
  points' locations.
  
  This is a frequent situation in experiments and computer simulations, where
  positions of points are taken at the same point in time (real time or
  simulated physical time). Thereby, the storage of redundant time stamp
  information per point is considered as obsolete.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of points.
type: group
NXcg_point_set(NXcg_primitive_set):
  position(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Coordinates of the points.
    unit: NX_ANY
    dim: (c, d)
  time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      (Elapsed) time for each point.
      
      If the field time is needed contextualize the time_offset relative to which
      time values are defined. Alternative store timestamp.
    unit: NX_TIME
    dim: (c,)
  timestamp(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      ISO8601 with local time zone offset for each point.
    dim: (c,)
  time_offset(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      ISO8601 with local time zone offset that serves as the reference
      for values in the field time.
