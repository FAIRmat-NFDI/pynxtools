  Base class to detail the marching cubes (MC) algorithm.
  
  Documenting which specific version of MC was used helps with understanding
  how robust the results are with respect to the topology of the triangulation.

  # we could also think about storing the rule sets in here explicitly including the
  # coordinate system conventions; however, the problem is that many commercial
  # tools like Matlab do not expose the rule set.
