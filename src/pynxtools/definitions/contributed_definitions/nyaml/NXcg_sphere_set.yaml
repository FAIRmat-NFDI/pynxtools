  Computational geometry description of a set of spheres.
  
  Each sphere can have a different radius but all need to have finite volume.
symbols:
  doc: |
    The symbols used in the schema to specify e.g. dimensions of arrays.
  d: |
    The dimensionality, which has to be at least 2.
  c: |
    The cardinality of the set, i.e. the number of circles or spheres.
# redundant as there is NXcsg, and NXquadric but easier to understand
type: group
NXcg_sphere_set(NXcg_ellipsoid_set):
  radius(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      In the case that all spheres have the same radius.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  radii(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      In the case that spheres have different radius use this
      instead of the radius field.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
