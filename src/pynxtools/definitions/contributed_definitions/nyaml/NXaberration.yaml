  Quantified aberration coefficient in an aberration_model.
type: group
NXaberration(NXobject):
  magnitude(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Value of the aberration coefficient.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  uncertainty(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Uncertainty of the value of the aberration coefficient
      according to uncertainty_model.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  uncertainty_model(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      How was the uncertainty quantified e.g. via the 95% confidence interval
      and using which algorithm or statistical model.
  delta_time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Time elapsed since the last measurement.
    unit: NX_TIME
  angle(NX_NUMBER):

      For the CEOS definitions the C aberrations are radial-symmetric and have
      no angle entry, while the A, B, D, S, or R aberrations are n-fold
      symmetric and have an angle entry.
      For the NION definitions the coordinate system differs to the one
      used in CEOS and instead two aberration coefficients a and b are used.
    unit: NX_ANGLE
  name(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Given name to this aberration.
  alias(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Alias also used to name and refer to this specific type of aberration.
