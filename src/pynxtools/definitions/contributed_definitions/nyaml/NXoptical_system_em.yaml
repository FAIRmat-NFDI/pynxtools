NXoptical_system_em(NXobject):
  # NEW ISSUE: for now used to store difficult to place entries
  # NEW ISSUE: all the definitions here should better be backed up by the
  # work of the HMC EM glossary activities
  camera_length(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Citing the JEOL TEM glossary this is *an effective distance from a specimen
      to a plane where an observed diffraction pattern is formed*.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  magnification(NX_NUMBER):  # R+ otherwise it is demagnification
    doc: |
      The factor of enlargement of the apparent size,
      not the physical size, of an object.
    unit: NX_DIMENSIONLESS
  defocus(NX_NUMBER):
    unit: NX_LENGTH
    doc: |
      The defocus aberration constant (oftentimes referred to as C_1_0).
      See respective details in :ref:`NXaberration` class instances.
  semi_convergence_angle(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Citing the JEOL TEM glossary this is the value *when a cone shaped,
      convergent electron beam illuminates a specimen, the semi-angle of the cone
      is termed convergence angle.*
    unit: NX_ANGLE
  field_of_view(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      The extent of the observable parts of the specimen given the current
      magnification and other settings of the instrument.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  working_distance(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Citing `Globalsino <https://www.globalsino.com/EM/page4586.html>`_ this is
      *a distance between the specimen and the lower pole piece in SEM system*.
    unit: NX_LENGTH
  beam_current(NX_NUMBER):
    # see AXON Dose monitoring paper doi:10.1017/S1551929522000840
    # this is the nominal dose rate e-/(angstrom^2*s)
    doc: |
      Beam current as measured relevant for the illumination of the specimen.
      Users should specify further details like how the beam current
      was measured using the beam_current_description field.
    unit: NX_CURRENT
  # replace with a dedicated base class to describe the dose rate, accumulated dose, dose rate history
  # based on the AXON Dose monitoring suggestions, for this one could also have an NXdose_monitoring base class
  # alternatively as that dose monitoring instrument as it is also described in the paper
  # is a modified Faraday cup sensor one could also wrap that detector in this base dose monitoring base class
  beam_current_description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Specify further details how the beam current was measured or estimated.
  # NEW ISSUE: the KIT/SCC propose:
  # adding of the image_mode or field mode
  # imageMode: enum: [normal_image, sad, eds, nbd, cbed]
  # fieldMode: enum: [dark_field, bright_field]
