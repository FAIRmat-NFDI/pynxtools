  (NXfabrication):
  pulse_mode(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Detail whereby ion extraction is triggered methodologically.
    enumeration: [laser, voltage, laser_and_voltage]
  pulse_frequency(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Frequency with which the pulser fire(s).
    # the example of how the IFES APT TC's HDF format deals with such data conceptually, concepts are mixed into superconcepts interleaved tuple with different units: "PulseFrequency : Real array, 2xn (Hz) This is the frequency of the high voltage or laser pulser. first entry : first pulse number where the spacing between this and all subsequent pulses are considered to be at the selected frequency. Each first entry must be strictly increasing in value. The second entry contains the frequency value" as data can be compressed in this case very efficiently we go for with an array of length 1xn_ions

  pulse_fraction(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Fraction of the pulse_voltage that is applied in addition
      to the standing_voltage at peak voltage of a pulse.
      
      If a standing voltage is applied, this gives nominal pulse fraction
      (as a function of standing voltage). Otherwise, this field should
      not be present.

  pulse_voltage(NX_FLOAT):
    doc: |
      Pulsed voltage, in laser pulsing mode this field can be omitted.
    # example of a conditional requirement that can be dealt with igorously by OWL but not by NeXus!
    # as either pulse_voltage is required in an appdef but then that
    # existence constraint is independent of other values.

      pulsing strategies to trigger ion extraction via exciting and eventual field evaporation
      field emission of ion at the specimen surface.

        Affine transformations which describe the geometry how the

        defined, how it has to be transformed so that it aligns with
        the specimen coordinate system.
      # A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, the so-called laser space,
      # should be assumed, whose positive z-axis points
      # into the direction of the propagating laser beam.
