  Base class for a region-of-interest (ROI) bound by geometric primitives.
  
  So-called region-of-interest(s) (ROIs) are typically used to describe a
  region in space (and time) where an observation is made or for which
  a computer simulation is performed with given boundary conditions.

    Use the depends_on fields of the respective specialized :ref:`NXcg_primitive_set`
    base class surplus :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set` with at least one instance
    of :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` to define explicitly the reference frame in
    which the primitives are defined.
    
    Alternatively, although disencouraged, one may use one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system_set`
    with with only one :ref:`NXcoordinate_system` in the application definition
    to specify implicitly in which reference frame the primitives are defined.
    
    If none of these two possibilities is used all primitives are assumed
    defined in the McStas coordinate system.
