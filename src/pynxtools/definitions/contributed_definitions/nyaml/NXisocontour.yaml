  Base class for describing isocontouring/phase-fields in Euclidean space.
  
  Iso-contouring algorithms such as Marching Cubes and others are frequently
  used to segment d-dimensional regions at crossings of a threshold value,
  the so-called isovalue.
  
  In Computational Materials Science phase-field methods are frequently used.
  Phase-field variables are discretized frequently using regular grids.
  
  Isocontour algorithms are often used in such context to pinpoint the
  locations of microstructural features from this implicit phase-field-
  variable-value-based description.
  
  One of the key intentions of this base class is to provide a starting point
  for scientists from the phase-field community (condensed-matter physicists,
  and materials engineers) to incentivize that also phase-field (and other)
  simulation data can take advantage of NeXus base class to improve
  interoperability.
