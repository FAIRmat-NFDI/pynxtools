NXcs_profiling_event(NXobject):
  start_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
      included when the event tracking started.
  end_time(NX_DATE_TIME):
    doc: |
      ISO 8601 time code with local time zone offset to UTC information
      included when the event tracking ended.
  description(NX_CHAR):
    doc: |
      Free-text description what was monitored/executed during the event.
  elapsed_time(NX_NUMBER):
    doc: |
      Wall-clock time how long the event took.
      
      This may be in principle end_time minus start_time; however usage of
      eventually more precise timers may warrant to use a finer temporal
      discretization, and thus demand for a more precise record of the
      wall-clock time.
      
      Elapsed time may contain time portions where resources were idling.
