         Metadata to a set of pieces of information of a resource that has been serialized.
         
         A typical use case is the documentation of the source (file) or database (entry)
         from which pieces of information have been extracted for consumption in e.g. a
         research data management system (RDMS). This may be for reasons of enabling
         services such as providing access to normalized information for which reading
         again from the resource may not be desired, possibe, or feasible.
         
         Possible reasons could be the extraction of specific information for caching,
         performance reasons, or re-evaluate given pieces of information based on other
         views and interaction patterns with the data where information has been formatted
         differently by tools than how these pieces of information were originally
         serialized.
