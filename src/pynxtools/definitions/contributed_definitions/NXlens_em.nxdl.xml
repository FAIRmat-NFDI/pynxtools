         Base class for an electro-magnetic lens or a compound lens.
         
         For :ref:`NXtransformations` the origin of the coordinate system is placed
         in the center of the lens (its polepiece, pinhole, or another
         point of reference). The origin should be specified in the :ref:`NXtransformations`.
         
         For details of electro-magnetic lenses in the literature
         see e.g. `L. Reimer &lt;https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-38967-5&gt;`_

    <field name="type" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Qualitative type of lens with respect to the number of pole pieces.

    <field name="name" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Given name, alias, colloquial, or short name for the lens.

             Excitation voltage of the lens.
             
             For dipoles it is a single number.
             For higher order multipoles, it is an array.

    </field>
    <field name="current" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_CURRENT">
        <doc>
             Excitation current of the lens.
             
             For dipoles it is a single number.
             For higher order multipoles, it is an array.

    </field>
    <field name="value" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_ANY">
        <doc>
             This field should be used when the exact voltage or current of the lens is not
             directly controllable as the control software of the microscope  does not enable
             or was not configured to display these values (for end users).
             
             In this case this value field should be used and the value
             from the control software stored as is.
             
             Although this value does not document the exact physical voltage or
             excitation, it can still give useful context to reproduce the lens setting,
             provided a properly working instrument and software sets the lens
             into a similar state to the technical level possible when no more 
             information is available physically or accessible legally.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="mode" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             This field should be used when the exact operation mode of the lens
             is not directly controllable as the control software of the microscope
             does not enable or was not configured to display these values.
             
             Like value the mode can only be interpreted for a specific microscope
             but can still be useful to guide users as to how to repeat the measurement.

    <attribute name="depends_on" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Specifies the position of the lens by pointing to the last transformation in the

        </doc>
    </attribute>
    <group type="NXtransformations">
        <doc>
             Collection of axis-based translations and rotations to describe the
             location and geometry of the lens as a component in the instrument.
             Typically, the components of a system should all be related relative to
             each other and only one component should relate to the reference
             coordinate system.
