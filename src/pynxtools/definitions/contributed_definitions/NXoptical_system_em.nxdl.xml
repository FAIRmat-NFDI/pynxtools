    <!--NEW ISSUE: for now used to store difficult to place entries
NEW ISSUE: all the definitions here should better be backed up by the
work of the HMC EM glossary activities-->
    <field name="camera_length" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Citing the JEOL TEM glossary this is *an effective distance from a specimen
             to a plane where an observed diffraction pattern is formed*.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="magnification" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_DIMENSIONLESS">
        <doc>
             The factor of enlargement of the apparent size,
             not the physical size, of an object.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="defocus" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             The defocus aberration constant (oftentimes referred to as C_1_0).
             See respective details in :ref:`NXaberration` class instances.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="semi_convergence_angle" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_ANGLE">
        <doc>
             Citing the JEOL TEM glossary this is the value *when a cone shaped,
             convergent electron beam illuminates a specimen, the semi-angle of the cone
             is termed convergence angle.*
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="field_of_view" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             The extent of the observable parts of the specimen given the current
             magnification and other settings of the instrument.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="working_distance" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Citing `Globalsino &lt;https://www.globalsino.com/EM/page4586.html&gt;`_ this is
             *a distance between the specimen and the lower pole piece in SEM system*.

        <!--
see AXON Dose monitoring paper doi:10.1017/S1551929522000840
this is the nominal dose rate e-/(angstrom^2*s)
-->
        <doc>
             Beam current as measured relevant for the illumination of the specimen.
             Users should specify further details like how the beam current
             was measured using the beam_current_description field.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <!--replace with a dedicated base class to describe the dose rate, accumulated dose, dose rate history
based on the AXON Dose monitoring suggestions, for this one could also have an NXdose_monitoring base class
alternatively as that dose monitoring instrument as it is also described in the paper
is a modified Faraday cup sensor one could also wrap that detector in this base dose monitoring base class-->
    <field name="beam_current_description" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Specify further details how the beam current was measured or estimated.

adding of the image_mode or field mode
imageMode: enum: [normal_image, sad, eds, nbd, cbed]
