         Base class for a set of components equipping an instrument with FIB capabilities.
         
         Focused-ion-beam (FIB) capabilities turn especially scanning electron microscopes
         into specimen preparation labs. FIB is a material preparation technique whereby
         portions of the sample are illuminated with a focused ion beam with controlled
         intensity. The beam is intense enough and with sufficient ion momentum to
         remove material in a controlled manner.
         
         The fact that an electron microscope with FIB capabilities has needs a
         second gun with own relevant control circuits, focusing lenses, and other
         components, warrants the definition of an own base class to group these
         components and distinguish them from the lenses and components for creating
         and shaping the electron beam.

doc: |
A right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used whose positive
z-axis points in the direction of the ion beam, i.e. towards the
sample. For modelling ion milling it is relevant to document the
illumination vector. NXtransformations offers a place to store how the
ion gun coordinate system has to be rotated to align its positive z-axis
with the positive z-axis of e.g. the electron beam and ion beam
respectively.-->
