    <doc>
         Base classes definition for bias spectroscopy.
         
         Bias sweeps while measuring arbitrary channels with I(V) curves.
    </doc>
    <field name="channels">
        <doc>
             Select the channels to record.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="reset_bias" type="NX_BOOLEAN">
        <doc>
             If chosen, the Bias voltage resets to its initial value (before the sweep initiation) at 
             the conclusion of the spectroscopy measurement. When this option is not selected, the Bias 
             voltage maintains the last value acquired during the sweep. This functionality proves 
             beneficial, especially when combining multiple sweep segments. As an illustration of an 
             automated measurement: turn off the z-Controller, commence spectroscopy sweep segments (
             forward sweep only, without resetting the bias), restore the bias to its initial value, 
             and then turn on the z-Controller.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="record_final_z" type="NX_BOOLEAN">
        <doc>
             Select whether to record the Z position during Z averaging time at the end of
             the sweep (after Z control time) and store the average value in the header of
             the file when saving. Using this option increases the sweep time by Z averaging
             time.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="lock_in_run" type="NX_BOOLEAN">
        <doc>
             Select whether to set the Lock-In to run during the measurement. When using this
             feature, make sure the Lock-In is configured correctly and settling times are
             set to twice the Lock-In period at least. This option is ignored when Lock-In is
             already running. This option is disabled if the Sweep Mode is MLS and the flag
             to configure the Lock-In per segment in the Multiline segment editor is set.

    <field name="num_pixel" type="NX_NUMBER">
        <doc>
             Define the sweep number of points, that is, the maximum spectrum resolution eq.
             Bias window divide by Num Pixel.

    </field>
    <field name="z_avg_time" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
        <doc>
             Duration over which the Z position is recorded and averaged before and after the
             sweep (the latter only if Record final Z position is selected in the Advanced
             section). After the initial z averaging time, if Z-Controller to Hold is
             selected in the Advanced section, the z-Controller is set to hold and the tip is
             placed at the previously averaged z position (plus z offset).
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="sw_filter_type" type="NX_CHAR">
        <doc>
             Select a filter to smooth the displayed data. When saving, if any filter is selected, 
             filtered data are saved to file along with the unfiltered data.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="sw_filter_order" type="NX_NUMBER">
        <doc>
             Filter order of a dynamic filter or width (in number of points) for the Gaussian
             filter.
        </doc>

    <field name="sw_filter_cutoff_frq" type="NX_NUMBER">

             Cutoff frequency for dynamic filters.

    <field name="z_offset" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_LENGTH">
        <doc>
             Offset added to the initial averaged position Zaver before starting to sweep.
             This parameter is disabled when Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the 
             Advanced section. The LED “Alt” next to the Z offset indicates if an alternate 
             Z-controller setpoint is enabled.
        </doc>

    <field name="settling_time" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">

    <field name="end_settling_time" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
        <doc>
             Time to wait after the sweep has finished and the bias is ramped to 
             the initial value.
        </doc>
    </field>
    <field name="z_control_time" type="NX_NUMBER" units="NX_TIME">
        <doc>
             Time during which the Z-Controller is enabled once a sweep has finished. 
             When averaging multiple sweeps (i.e. Sweeps&gt;1), the Z-Controller is enabled
             for this duration between each sweep. After the last sweep, it will wait the
             specified time before continuing a running scan. This ensures each sweep 
             reliably starts from the same position. This parameter is disabled when 
             Z-Controller to Hold is deselected in the Advanced section.

             are disabled.
