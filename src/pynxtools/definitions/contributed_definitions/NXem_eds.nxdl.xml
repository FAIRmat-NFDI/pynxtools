         Base class method-specific for energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDXS).
         
         `IUPAC instead of Siegbahn notation &lt;https://doi.org/10.1002/xrs.1300200308&gt;`_ should be used.
         
         X-ray spectroscopy is a surface-sensitive technique. Therefore, three-dimensional elemental
         characterzation requires typically a sequence of characterization and preparation of the
         surface to expose a new surface layer that can be characterized in the next acquisition.
         In effect, the resulting three-dimensional elemental information mappings are truely the
         result of a correlation and post-processing of several measurements which is the field
         of correlative tomographic usage of electron microscopy.
