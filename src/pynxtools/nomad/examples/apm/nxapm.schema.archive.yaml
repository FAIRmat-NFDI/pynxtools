                description: |
                  Chemical composition of the sample. The composition from e.g.
                  a composition table can be added as individual strings.
                  One string for each element with statements separated via a
                  single space. The string is expected to have the following format:
                  Symbol value unit +- stdev

                  An example: B 1. +- 0.2, means
                  composition of boron 1. at.-% +- 0.2 at.%.
                  If a string contains only a symbol this is interpreted
                  that the symbol specifies the matrix or remainder element
                  for the composition table.

                  If unit is omitted or named % this is interpreted as at.-%.
                  Unit can be at% or wt% but all strings have to use either atom
                  or weight percent but no mixtures.
                  No unit for stdev should be repeated as it has to be the
                  same unit as is used for the composition value.
