# em_nion reader

## Status
This reader is considered deprecated for two reasons: First, the NeXus application definition
NXem_nion has been superseeded by NXem, which is functionally and conceptually much more covering
and most importantly not restricted to users of Nion microscopes. Second, we have been working on an export
functionality inside nionswift. Nionswift is the control software for users of Nion microscopes.

In effect, this reader will be removed with one of the next updates of nomad-parser-nexus.
