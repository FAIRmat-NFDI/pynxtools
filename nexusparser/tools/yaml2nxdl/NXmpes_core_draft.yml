#a draft version of a NeXus application definition for arpes,
#the existing NXarpes is too restrictive, this application definition aims at generalizing it
#to be agnostic of the experimental details.
#the draft uses the application example of a simple 2D slice through the k-space, the elementary unit of
#arpes measurements.
#It uses only existing NeXus base classes. It is designed to be extended by other application definitions
# with higher granularity in the data description.

name: NXmpes_core # Decided to use "core" and not "base" to avoid confusion with "base class". This is the most general (core) appdef.
