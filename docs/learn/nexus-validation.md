# NeXus validation
!!! info "Work in progress"

One of the main advantages of using pynxtools is that it comes with its own validation tools. That is, it can be used to validate that a given NeXus/HDF5 file is compliant with a NeXus application definition.

## As part of the dataconverter
During [data conversion](./dataconverter-and-readers.md), before writing the HDF5 file, the data is first checked against the provided application definition.

<!--## verify-nexus: Testing existing NeXus/HDF5 files
This CLI tool can be used to validate _existing_ HDF5 files that claim to be NeXus-compliant. See [here](reference/cli-api.md#verify-nexus) for the API documentation.-->

## read_nexus: NeXus file reader and debugger

This utility outputs a debug log for a given NeXus file by annotating the data and metadata entries with the schema definitions from the respective NeXus base classes and application definitions to which the file refers to. See [here](../reference/cli-api.md#read_nexus) for the API documentation.

The following example dataset can be used to test the `read_nexus` module: [src/pynxtools/data/201805_WSe2_arpes.nxs](https://github.com/FAIRmat-NFDI/pynxtools/blob/master/src/pynxtools/data/201805_WSe2_arpes.nxs).

This is an angular-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) dataset that is formatted according to
the [NXarpes application definition of NeXus](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/applications/NXarpes.html#nxarpes).

### Using a different set of NeXus definitions
The environment variable "NEXUS_DEF_PATH" can be set to a directory which contains the NeXus definitions as NXDL XML files. If this environment variable is not defined, the module will use the definitions in its bundle (see `src/pynxtools/definitions`)._

The environment variable can be set as follows:
```
export 'NEXUS_DEF_PATH'=<folder_path_that_contains_nexus_defs>
```

### A note to Windows users
If you run `read_nexus` from `git bash`, you need to set the environmental variable
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` to avoid the [path translation in Windows Git MSys](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7250130/how-to-stop-mingw-and-msys-from-mangling-path-names-given-at-the-command-line#34386471).
The easiest way is to prefix the `read_nexus` call with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`:

```
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 read_nexus -c /NXarpes/ENTRY/INSTRUMENT/analyser
```

This workaround was tested with Windows 11, but should very likely also work with Windows 10 and lower.

## Other approaches (not part of pynxtools)
Aside from the tools we developed within FAIRmat, the [official NeXus website](https://manual.nexusformat.org/validation.htm) lists two more programs for the validation of NeXus files:

1. nxvalidate
2. punx
