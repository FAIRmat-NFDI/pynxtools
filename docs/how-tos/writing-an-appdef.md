# Writing a Simple Application Definition

!!! danger "Work in progress"

    This part of the documentation is still being written and it might be confusing or incomplete.

Concept of this How-to:

Create an example file NXdouble_slit

NXslit_experiments --> NXdouble_slit
NXslit_experiments --> NXsingle_slit

They should learn the basic principles of how nexus works, the different path notations
- Principles of nexus
    - concepts
    - appdefs
    - base classes
- Inheritance of application definitions and base classes
- Connection of concept paths and instance paths
- Description of appdef/base class notation (upper and lower case)
- Basic tools for creation (pynxtools) and verification (pynxtools?) of nexus files

Additional information (i.e., not in this tutorial but linked to this):
- Creating a reader in pynxtools
- Reading/writing nexus data in nomad
