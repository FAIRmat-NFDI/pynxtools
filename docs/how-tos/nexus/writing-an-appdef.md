# Writing an application definition

!!! danger "Work in progress"

    This part of the documentation is still being written and it might be confusing or incomplete.

Concept of this How-to:

Create an example file NXdouble_slit

NXslit_experiments --> NXdouble_slit
NXslit_experiments --> NXsingle_slit

They should learn the basic principles of how nexus works, the different path notations

- Principles of nexus
    - concepts
    - application definitions
    - base classes
- Inheritance of application definitions and base classes
- Connection of concept paths and instance paths
- Description of application definition/base class notation (upper and lower case)
- Basic tools for creation (pynxtools) and verification (pynxtools?) of nexus files

Additional information (i.e., not in this tutorial but linked to this):

- Creating a reader in pynxtools
- Reading/writing nexus data in nomad


The requirements are set by the community _via_ workshops or at conferences. To initiate or propose changes/additions, you can comment the FAIRMat NeXus proposal by going to the [NeXus definitions](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/index.html#), and using the hypothes.is tool (sign-up/log-in) to give us some feedback (Red boxes in the image.
