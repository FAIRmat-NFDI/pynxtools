# NeXus definitions

We link two references here.
The first links to the official definitions by the [NIAC](http://www.nexusformat.org) and the second one links to latest FAIRmat definitions.

- [Official NIAC definitions](https://manual.nexusformat.org/classes/index.html)
- [Latest FAIRmat definitions](https://fairmat-nfdi.github.io/nexus_definitions/)

The FAIRmat definitions are regularly contributed to NIAC (around every 6 months) but generally reflect
a state which is still under development and may contain new or improved application definitions or base classes.
Consider it as the public review stage of these application definitions.
However, there might be some parts which are still under discussion and will be subject to change.
