# this example exemplifies the situation for the TFS/FEI SEM Apreo from the IKZ of Prof. Martin Albrecht
# thanks to Robert Kernke it was clarified the microscope has several detectors and imaging modes
# these imaging modes control the specific TFS/FEI concept instances stored in the respective TIFF file
# we here use a glossary of all concepts which we were able to parse out from an example image
# taken for each detector and imaging mode
# we then assume that one can work with the joint set of these concepts

# there is more to know and understand than just knowing TFS/FEI uses
# the above-mentioned concepts in their taxonomy:
# take the example of System/Source for which an example file (instance) has the
# value "FEG"
# similar like in NeXus "System/Source" labels a concept for which (assumption!) there
# is a controlled enumeration of symbols possible (as the example shows "FEG" is one such
# allowed symbol of the enumeration.
# The key issue is that the symbols for the leaf (here "FEG") means nothing eventually
# when one has another semantic world-view, like in NOMAD metainfo or NeXus
# (only us) humans understand that what TFS/FEI likely means with the symbol
# "FEG" is exactly the same as what we mean in NeXus when setting emitter_type of
# NXebeam_column to "cold_cathode_field_emitter"
# world with the controlled enumeration value "other" because we do not know
# if FEG means really a filament or a cold_cathode_field_emitter
