# DREAM3D implements essentially a data analysis workflow with individual steps
# in the DREAM3D jargon each step is referred to as a filter, filters have well-defined
# name and version, each filter takes dependent on its version specific input and
# generates predictable output, this is a benefit and signature of the professional
# design and idea behind DREAM3D
# in effect, the combination of versioned filters used in combination with the DREAM3D
# software version and file version defines how results end up in a DREAM3D file

# TODO::to capture every possible output one would keep a record of the individual
# schemes for each filter and the differences in these between versions
# considering the fact that DREAM3D is still in a process of migrating from previous
# versions to a so-called DREAM3DNX (more professional) version we do not wish to explore
# for now how this filter-based schema version can be implemented
# instead we leave it with a few examples, here specifically how to extract if
# available inverse pole figure maps for the reconstructed discretized three-dimensional
# microstructure which is the key task that DREAM3D enables users to generate from a
# collection of EBSD mappings obtained via serial-sectioning

# idea behind this implementation:
# e.g. a materials scientists/engineer working in the field of e.g. ICME
# generating N microstructure reconstructions from M measurements
# in general N and M >= 1 and N can be N >> M i.e. one serial-section study with
# hundreds of different microstructures, typical case for exploring phase space
# of thermo-chemo-mechanical material response effect of structure on properties
# in this case each DREAM3D run should be supplemented with contextualizing metadata
# e.g. collected via an ELN e.g. user, material, measurement used, etc. i.e. all those
# pieces of information which are not documented by or not documentable currently by
# the DREAM3D software within its own realm
# in effect a research may have say N ~= 1000 uploads with one DREAM3D instance each
# benefits: i) for the researcher search across explore, ii) for many researchers explore
# and contextualize

# DREAM3D constants
