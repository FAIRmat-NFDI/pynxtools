# the base parser implements the processing of standardized orientation maps via
# the pyxem software package from the electron microscopy community
# specifically so-called NeXus default plots are generated to add RDMS-relevant
# information to the NeXus file which supports scientists with judging the potential
# value of the dataset in the context of them using research data management systems (RDMS)
# in effect this parser is the partner of the MTex parser for all those file formats
# which are HDF5 based and which (at the time of working on this example Q3/Q4 2023)
# where not supported my MTex
# with offering this parser we also would like to embrace and acknowledge the efforts
# of other electron microscopists (like the pyxem team, hyperspy etc.) and their work
# towards software tools which are complementary to the MTex texture toolbox
# one could have also implemented the HDF5 parsing inside MTex but we leave this as a
# task for the community and instead focus here on showing a more diverse example
# towards more interoperability between the different tools in the community

# Like TIFF, HDF5 is a container file format
# Therefore, inspecting the mime type alone is insufficient to infer the schema
# with which the content in the HDF5 file is formatted
# Therefore, at least some of the content and how that content is
# formatted is inspected to make an informed decision which specific hfive
# subparser can be expected to deal at all with the content of the HDF5 file

# For the example of EBSD there was once a suggestion made by the academic community
# to report EBSD results via HDF5, specifically via H5EBSD (Jackson et al.).
# Different tech partners and community projects though have implemented these
# ideas differently. In effect, there are now multiple HDF5 files circulating
# in the EBSD community where the same conceptual information is stored
# differently i.e. under different names

# This function shows an example how this dilemna can be
# solved for six examples that all are HDF5 variants used for "storing EBSD data"
# oxford - H5OINA format of Oxford Instrument
# edax - OIMself.input_file_path Analysis based reporting of EDAX/AMETEK
# apex - APEX based reporting of EDAX/AMETEK (can be considered the newer EDAX reporting)
# bruker - Bruker Esprit based reporting which replaces Bruker's bcf format that
#     is notoriously difficult to parse as it uses a commercial library SFS from AidAim
# emsort - HDF5-based reporting of parameter used by Marc de Graeff's EMsoft
#     dynamic electron diffraction simulation software
# hebsd - a variant of Jackson's proposal of the original H5EBSD the example here
#    explores from content of the community as used by e.g. T. B. Britton's group
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31146036/how-do-i-traverse-a-hdf5-file-using-h5py

# rules is a dictionary of pairs: first, a templatized path, second, an identifier
# what is a templatized path? take this example from an v4 H5OINA file with SEM/ESBD data
# 1/Data Processing/Analyses/IPF1, IS_GROUP
# 1/Data Processing/Analyses/IPF2, IS_GROUP
# both pathes are conceptually instances of the same concept
# */Data Processing/Analyses/IPF*
# where the stars in this templatized path serve as placeholders
# masking different instance ids
# Contextualization:
# HDF5 is a container (file) format lik TIFF.
# Therefore, neither the mime type nor the file name suffix can substantiate
# which not just format but version an instance comes formatted with.
# Therefore, the specific content and formatting of an instance
# e.g. do we talk about an HDF5 file whose content matches the rules
# of an e.g. Oxford Instrument v4 H5OINA file?
# the versioning is key to understand and read
# tech partners can make changes to I/O routines in their software
# this can result in that data end up formatted differently across file
# instances written over time
# therefore, it is necessary to ensure (before interpreting the file) that
# it matches a certain set of expectations (versioned format) so that the
# information content aka the knowledge, the pieces of information, in that file
# can be logically interpreted correctly
# The existence of a libraries and only best practices but not generally accepted
# rules how content in container files should be formatted enables for a
# potentially large number of possibilities how the same piece of information
# is encoded
# Consider the following simple example from electron microscopy with two quantities:
# hv (high_voltage) and wd (working_distance)
# these are two numbers each with a unit category or actual unit instance
# (voltage) and (length) respectively
# in hdf5 one could store the same information very differently technically
# as a dataset instance named "hv" with a scalar number and an attribute
# instance with a scalar string for the unit
# (this is assumed somewhat the best practice)
# however neither this is required nor assured
# in practice one could do much more e.g.
# as a group named hv_voltage with an attribute value
# as a compound dataset with two values packed as a struct with pairs of value and string
# first the value for hv followed by its unit, thereafter the value of wd followed by its unit
# also nobody is required to name an HDF5 instance using English because nodes in HDF5
# end up as links and these can have UTF8 encoding, so in principle even group and dataset names
# can use terms from other languages than English, one can use also special characters
# there can be typos or synonyms used like hv and high_voltage or voltage
# the key point is all these representations are allowed when we use HDF5 files
# but for each of these combinations a different code has to be implemented to extract
# and verify these pieces of information when one would like to use these pieces
# for further processing, this observation holds for every serialization of information
# into a file and thus one cannot escape the necessity that one needs to define
# a clear set of rules based on which one can decide if some instance is interpretable or
# not, in general we therefore see that there is much more work need that just to acknowledge
# that it is clear that one cannot infer the potential relevance of a file for an analysis
# based on its file format ending (mime type, magic cookie) etc
# although interesting this is exactly what the magic cookie
# (the initial few bytes to the beginning of the byte stream of a file)
# were originally conceptualized for
