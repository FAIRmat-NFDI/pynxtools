This is the place for storing code for tests which probe key functionalities of the nexus(checker).
Nexuschecker is a core package of which implements functionalities for traversing the XML tree
that is behind the hierarchical data model of NeXus. The nexuschecker `nexus.py` can also be used
as a standalone tool to check how an instance of a NeXus/HDF5 file compares to a given application definition.

<span style="color:red">Sandor, please reactivate here your checker code from the master branch and maybe add a small description here.</span>
