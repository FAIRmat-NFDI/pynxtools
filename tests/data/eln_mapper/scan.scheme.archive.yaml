              Template of instrument descriptions comprising various beamline components.
              Each component will also be a NeXus group defined by its distance from
              the sample. Negative distances represent beamline components that are

                        ordering should follow a principle of slowest to fastest measurement
                        axes and may be explicitly specified in application definitions.
                        Mechanical scanning of objects (e.g. sample position/angle,
                        incident beam energy, etc) tends to be the slowest part of
                        an experiment and so any such scan axes should be allocated
                        to the first dimensions of the array. Note that in some cases
                        it may be useful to represent a 2D set of scan points as a
                        single scan-axis in the data array, especially if the scan
                        pattern doesn't fit a rectangular array nicely. Repetition
                        of an experiment in a time series tends to be used similar
                        to a slow scan axis and so will often be in the first dimension
                        of the data array. The next fastest axes are typically the
                        readout of the detector. A point detector will not add any
                        dimensions (as it is just a single value per scan point) to
                        the data array, a strip detector will add one dimension, an
                        imaging detector will add two dimensions (e.g. X, Y axes)
                        and detectors outputting higher dimensional data will add
                        the corresponding number of dimensions. Note that the detector
                        dimensions don't necessarily have to be written in order of
                        the actual readout speeds - the slowest to fastest rule principle
                        is only a guide. Finally, detectors that operate in a time-of-flight
                        mode, such as a neutron spectrometer or a silicon drift detector
                        (used for X-ray fluorescence) tend to have their dimension(s)
                        added to the last dimensions in the data array. The type of
                        each dimension should should follow the order of scan points,
                        detector pixels, then time-of-flight (i.e. spectroscopy, spectrometry).
