abstract = {NeXus is a data format for the exchange of neutron and synchrotron scattering data between facilities and user institutions. It has been developed by an international team of scientists and computer programmers from neutron and X-ray facilities around the world. The NeXus format uses the hierarchical data format (HDF) which is portable, binary, extensible and self-describing. The NeXus format defines the structure and contents of these HDF files in order to facilitate the visualization and analysis of neutron and X-ray data. In addition, an application program interface (API) is being produced in order to simplify the reading and writing of NeXus files. The details of the format are available at 〈http://www.neutron.anl.gov/NeXus/〉.}

  abstract={The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}
