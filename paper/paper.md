# Summary

pynxtools is a Python framework that standardizes experimental data conversion to NeXus HDF5 format across diverse scientific domains. Unlike other tools, pynxtools provides a fixed set of NeXus application definitions that ensures convergence and alignment in data definitions across photoemission spectroscopy (XPS, MPES), electron microscopy, atom probe tomography, optical spectroscopy (ellipsometry, Raman), scanning probe microscopy (STM, AFM), and X-ray diffraction. This standardized approach addresses the historical problem of incompatible formats across research communities. Through its modular plugin architecture, pynxtools automatically maps vendor-specific raw data and electronic lab notebook metadata to these unified definitions, while performing validation to ensure data correctness and NeXus compliance. By simplifying the adoption of standardized application definitions, the framework enables true data interoperability and FAIR data management across multiple experimental techniques.


# Statement of need

Scientific data across experimental physics and materials science remains largely non-FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible) due to the complexity and inconsistent implementation of standardized data formats. While NeXus provides comprehensive application definitions for structured scientific data storage, researchers typically struggle with its verbose specification requirements, leading to incomplete implementations, non-compliant outputs, or abandonment of standardization efforts entirely. Existing tools lack comprehensive validation frameworks and provide insufficient guidance for proper NeXus adoption. pynxtools addresses this critical gap by providing an accessible framework that enforces complete NeXus application definition compliance through automated validation, detailed error reporting for missing required fields, and clear implementation pathways via configuration files and extensible plugins. This approach transforms NeXus from a complex specification into a practical solution, enabling researchers to achieve true data interoperability without deep technical expertise in the underlying standards.

# Mathematics

Single dollars ($) are required for inline mathematics e.g. $f(x) = e^{\pi/x}$

Double dollars make self-standing equations:

$$\Theta(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{l}
0\textrm{ if } x < 0\cr
1\textrm{ else}
\end{array}\right.$$

You can also use plain \LaTeX for equations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fourier}
\hat f(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{i\omega x} dx
\end{equation}
and refer to \autoref{eq:fourier} from text.

# Citations

Citations to entries in paper.bib should be in
[rMarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html)
format.

If you want to cite a software repository URL (e.g. something on GitHub without a preferred
citation) then you can do it with the example BibTeX entry below for @fidgit.

For a quick reference, the following citation commands can be used:
- `@author:2001`  ->  "Author et al. (2001)"
- `[@author:2001]` -> "(Author et al., 2001)"
- `[@author1:2001; @author2:2001]` -> "(Author1 et al., 2001; Author2 et al., 2002)"

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
